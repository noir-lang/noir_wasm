# Noir Lang WASM JavaScript Package

This JavaScript package enables users to compile a Noir program, i.e. generating its artifacts.

The package also handles dependency management similarly as how Nargo (Noir's CLI tool) opreates, but it is not used for proving, verifying and simulating functions, just compilation.
